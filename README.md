# Overview of the passwordstealer
This repository contains a batch script that copies Chrome's Login Data file from the user's local Chrome profile to a specified location. The Login Data file contains encrypted saved passwords and login information, which can be used in various scenarios (e.g., backup, data analysis, etc.).

# Purpose of the Script
The batch file is designed to copy the Login Data file stored by Google Chrome. This file typically contains user credentials such as usernames and passwords for websites that have been saved in Chrome.

batch
Copy code
copy "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data" <destination_path>
Key Components
%userprofile%: The batch file uses the %userprofile% environment variable to dynamically reference the current user's home directory. This ensures compatibility across different systems without hardcoding user-specific paths.

Source Path:

AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data: This is the path where Chrome stores the user's saved login credentials.
Destination Path:

The script allows you to specify the target path where you want to copy the Login Data file. Ensure that the destination path has write permissions.
Usage
To use the batch file, simply run it on a Windows system where Chrome is installed. It will copy the Login Data file from Chrome's default profile to the specified location.

# Clone the repository.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the batch file is located.
Run the batch script with the appropriate destination path.
bash
Copy code
copy_login_data.bat "C:\Backup\ChromeData"
Security Considerations
Sensitive Data: The Login Data file contains encrypted saved passwords and login information. While the file does not store plaintext passwords, it can be decrypted using the same system on which it was generated (via Windows' Data Protection API).

Be cautious about sharing or storing this file in insecure locations.
Ensure that any access to this file is protected, as malicious actors can potentially decrypt it if they have access to the local system.
Privacy: This script accesses sensitive user data, so it should only be used on systems where you have the necessary permissions and ownership of the data.

# Prerequisites
This script works only on Windows-based systems where Google Chrome is installed.
It assumes that the Chrome profile is stored in its default location under the AppData folder.
Legal Disclaimer
Use of this script to access Chrome's Login Data file should comply with the local laws and regulations governing the use of sensitive personal data. Ensure that you have permission to access and copy the file before proceeding.
Example Section
Here's an example of the file in the repository that could be included in the README:

batch
Copy code
@echo off
set destination=%1
copy "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data" "%destination%"
echo Login Data file has been copied to %destination%
pause
In this script, replace %1 with the desired destination path when running the script.
